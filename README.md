hi this is essentially a school project i thought it would be cool to be able to share with friends. so if you stumble onto this... hello.

it's just a chat app that is more or less custom made by me, nothing really special. it currently lacks some features, obviously, it's just a school project (and we're not that far into our programming course yet).

currently to run the server and share it, i only personally know how to do it with port forwarding, such as hamachi, but eh, it works. i may figure something else out soon.
